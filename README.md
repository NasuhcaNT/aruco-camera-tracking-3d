# aruco-camera-tracking-3d
This project uses ArUco markers to track a camera's 3D position and visualize its movement in real-time. With OpenCV and Matplotlib, it detects markers, estimates poses, and displays position/distance data on the video feed. Ideal for augmented reality, robotics, or spatial tracking applications.
